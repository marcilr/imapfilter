IMAPFilter is a mail filtering utility.  It connects to
remote mail servers using the Internet Message Access Protocol
(IMAP), sends searching queries to the server and processes
mailboxes based on the results.  It can be used to delete, copy,
move, flag, etc. messages residing in mailboxes at the same or
different mail servers.  The 4rev1 and 4 versions of the IMAP
protocol are supported.

IMAPFilter uses the Lua programming language as a configuration
and extension language.
