Comments


A comment starts anywhere with a double hyphen (--) and runs
until the end of the line.  Lua also offers block comments,
which start with --[[ and run until the corresponding ]].
A common trick, when we want to comment out a piece of code,
is to write the following:

    --[[
    print(10)         -- no action (comment)
    --]]

Now, if we add a single hyphen to the first line, the code is in again:

    ---[[
    print(10)         --> 10
    --]]

In the first example, the -- in the last line is still inside the block
comment. In the second example, the sequence ---[[ does not start a
block comment; so, the print is outside comments.  In this case, the
last line becomes an independent comment, as it starts with --.
